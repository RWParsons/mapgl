The **mapgl** R package makes the latest versions of Mapbox GL JS and Maplibre GL JS available to R users. The package interface is designed to make the powerful capabilities of both libraries available in R mapping projects, but also feel similar to users coming from other R mapping packages.

### Using Mapbox GL JS

A basic map:

```{r}
library(mapgl)

mapboxgl()
```

Customizing the style and projection:

```{r}
mapboxgl(
  style = mapbox_style("satellite"),
  projection = "winkelTripel"
)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mapboxgl(
  center = c(-97.6, 25.4)
) |> 
  fly_to(
    center = c(-96.810481, 32.790869),
    zoom = 18.4,
    pitch = 75,
    bearing = 136.8
  )
```

### Using Maplibre GL JS

```{r}
maplibre()
```

```{r}
maplibre(
  style = maptiler_style("bright"),
  center = c(-43.23412, -22.91370),
  zoom = 14
) |> 
  add_fullscreen_control(position = "top-left") |> 
  add_navigation_control()
```
